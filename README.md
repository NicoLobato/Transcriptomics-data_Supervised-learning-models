# Supervised Learning Models for Transcriptomics Data

This repository contains **Machine Learning (ML) algorithms** for analysing **transcriptomics data**. Throughout the analysis, we will determine which algorithm is the most suitable for our data, focusing on its predictive power. The data comprises thousands of genes expression levels in *Pinus Pinaster* samples. The ML algorithms aim to identify biomarkers for drought resistance within the data. Since we know the labels of the samples, we will use supervised learning models for this analysis. The main goal is to label the samples, so we will implement classification algorithms, including **Lasso-penalised Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, **Boosting** and **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**.

Samples are characterised by three traits to predict: **treatment type** (Control/Drought), **stem type** (Tolerant/Sensitive) and **root type** (Tolerant/Sensitive). Consequently, the repository is divided into the following sections:

- Section 0: Data Preparation

## Treatment type
- Section 1: Lasso-penalised Logistic Regression
- Section 2: Random Forest
- Section 3: Boosting
- Section 4: SVM

## Stem type
- Section 1: Lasso-penalised Logistic Regression
- Section 2: Random Forest
- Section 3: Boosting
- Section 4: SVM

## Root type
- Section 1: Lasso-penalised Logistic Regression
- Section 2: Random Forest
- Section 3: Boosting
- Section 4: SVM
